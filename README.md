Hey, I'm not a Frog really (i don't think) but i am a:
* C++ & Python Software engineer who works on offshore control systems
* I'm interested in embedded systems, C and reverse engineering both Software and API's
* I also tend to make oddly specific projects that ultimately only make sense to me (and often reinvent the wheel)
